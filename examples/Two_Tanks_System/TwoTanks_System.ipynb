    "## Background information\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to use _numerous_ to create a system of multiple components.\n",
    "The tutorial is aimed at demonstrating the usability and scalability of the model architecture for systems with multiple physical components connected bewteen each other by means of connectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is built based on a relative simple system, e.g. two tanks are placed on top of each other and connected by a valve. The implementation using _numerous_ might therefore seems tedious and over-complicated, given the limited number of components and thus equations to solve. However, as already pintpointed, we wish to illustrate how systems can be created, and how _numerous_ model architecture would be advantegeous for systems with a high degree of complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model implementation is developed by instantiating _items_ of different classes, and connecting them by means of _connectors_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial can be run only importing the extra packages pandas, numpy and plotly."

    "## System governing equations\n",
    "\n",
    "A system of two tanks and a valve is shown in the figure below. H indicates the height of a certain mass M of liquid in each tank. The liquid density is indicated by $\\rho$, while the cross-sectional area of each tank is indicated by the parameter $A_0$.The mass flow rate through the valve is determined by a valve characteristic parameter  $\\mathrm{C_v}$.\n",
    "![Screenshot.png](sketch_tanks.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At time 0, the top tank (tank 1) is filled with a certain amount of liquid, determining the height $\\mathrm{H_1}$, while the bottom tank (tank 2) is completely empty. If the valve is opened at time 0, a mass flow rate starts flowing through the valve between tank 1 and tank 2. After a given time (that we indicate as $t_\\mathrm{filling}$) the top tank will be empty, while the bottom tank will contain the entire mass of liquiq.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical model describing this systme is illusrated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the mass flow rate through the valve is proportional to the pressure drop accross the valve by the relation:\n",

    "## Analytical solution\n",
    "The system of differential equations above can be quite complex to solve analytically given the time dependence of $\\mathrm{C_v}$. Therefore, a numerical solver can be used to solve the system, and we will show in this tutorial how to create a model and to solve it using _numerous_.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If we equal the parameter to a constant value over time  $\\mathrm{C_v}(t) = \\mathrm{C_v}$, it is possible to solve the system analytically. In fact, the integration of the previous equations leads to the solution:\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathrm{H_1(t)} = \\Bigg[\\sqrt{\\mathrm{H_{1,0}}} - \\dfrac{\\mathrm{C_v}}{2 A_{0,1}} \\sqrt{\\dfrac{g}{\\rho}} \\cdot t \\Bigg]^{2}\n",

    "$$\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
